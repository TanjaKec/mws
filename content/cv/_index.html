<h3>RESEARCH</h3>
<p>My research work has developed my knowledge and skills within the area of statistical modelling and statistical computing, which are now regarded as a practical tools for researchers. As such, the area of my research enhances the opportunities for cross discipline research projects.</p>
<p>A part of my research is focused on the study of a kernel smooth bootstrap method for assessing the accuracy of a quantile parametric regression function estimate, based on estimation of the conditional variance function. The study examines a variety of approaches to estimate the conditional variance function. These include the adaptation of GLMs as well as non-parametric regression based estimation, which are assessed under various data structures simulated in <em>R</em>, public domain language for data analysis.</p>
<p>To validate the proposed bootstrap method I have carried out extensive simulation studies. The performance of the proposed method has also been compared with many other existing methods, which requires substantial statistical knowledge and high level computational skills.</p>
<p>Apart form statistical modelling my interests are also in the area of statistical computing and data visualisations, which can make exploring data feel more compelling. Interactive visualisation can be an effective form for engaging an audience who might not otherwise care about the topic or data at hand.</p>
<p>In general, I find joy in analysing complex data sets to create clear and compelling reports, visualisations, and interactive apps. I love to write educational materials to develop data literacy.</p>
