\subsubsection{RESEARCH}\label{research}}

My research work has developed my knowledge and skills within the area
of statistical modelling and statistical computing, which are now
regarded as a practical tools for researchers. As such, the area of my
research enhances the opportunities for cross discipline research
projects.

A part of my PhD research focused on the study of a kernel smooth
bootstrap method for assessing the accuracy of a quantile parametric
regression function estimate, based on estimation of the conditional
variance function. The study examines a variety of approaches to
estimate the conditional variance function. These include the adaptation
of GLMs as well as non-parametric regression based estimation, which are
assessed under various data structures simulated in \emph{R}, public
domain language for data analysis.

To validate the proposed bootstrap method I have carried out extensive
simulation studies. The performance of the proposed method has also been
compared with many other existing methods, which requires substantial
statistical knowledge and high level computational skills.

Apart form statistical modelling my interests are also in the area of
statistical computing and data visualisations, which can make exploring
data feel more compelling. Interactive visualisation can be an effective
form for engaging an audience who might not otherwise care about the
topic or data at hand.

In general, I find joy in analysing complex data sets to create clear
and compelling reports, visualisations, and interactive apps. I love to
write educational materials to develop data literacy.
